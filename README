In GoSMS app for Android you can use a custom vibration pattern when you recieved a new message.
So I want to use a pattern with the rythms of the ringtone.

To use the vibration pattern I created a very simple application to generate a pattern according to the ringtone.
My ringtone is a Zelda sound.

The pattern is generated with the SPACE BAR.
Just copy the generated pattern in your GoSMS apps
